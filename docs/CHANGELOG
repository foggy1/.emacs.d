* v0.2.0    UNRELEASED

- The new option ~transient-display-buffer-action~ allows users to
  specify how a window is selected to display the transient popup
  buffer.  The ~lv~ library is no longer used.  #17

- The new option ~transient-mode-line-format~ allows users to use
  a mode-line for the transient popup buffer instead of just a
  thin line that separates it from the echo area.  When using a
  non-standard value for ~transient-display-buffer-action~ it may
  be necessary to do that.  #17

- Added new commands ~transient-scroll-up~ and ~transient-scroll-down~,
  which scroll the transient window.  ~C-v~ and ~M-v~ (and ~<next>~ and
  ~<prior>~) are bound to these commands.  These keys were choosen they
  are bound to scrolling commands in the global map too.  This made
  it necessary to find a new binding for ~transient-show~, which ~C-t~ is
  bound to now.  #17

- A new keymap, ~transient-base-map~ was added to make it easier to
  change key bindings that are shared between all transients.  This
  new keymap is used as the parent of all the other keymaps that are
  shared between all transients.

- The window that was selected before the transient window was shown
  is no longer re-selected before calling a suffix that exits the
  transient.  If a suffix changes the selected window unintentionally,
  then that is a bug.  This makes it possible to intentionally change
  the window layout using transients.

- An infix is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context
  "suffixes" means "suffixes (including infixes)" or "non-infix
  suffixes".  This is now mention in a few places where users might
  otherwise get confused.

- Stopped claiming that the transient is shown in the "echo area",
  because technically that is not correct.  Instead talk about the
  "popup buffer".

- Fixed handling of suffix commands that are undefined at the time the
  prefix is invoked.  This is still an error, but the error message
  now explains what is wrong.  a729bbb

- Fixed saving values/history/levels, making sure that the printed
  expression is never abbreviated.  #15

- Fixed jumping to the correct place in a manpage when showing the
  documentation for an infix argument.  c4bf4af

- Bound ~ESC ESC ESC~ to ~transient-quit-all~ because the convention is
  that it should be possible to exit any temporary state using this
  binding.  #12

- Fixed referencing suffix bindings by their key when the key binding
  is defined in the suffix object instead of in the suffix spec.

- Remove trailing whitespace from popup text for the benefit of users
  who have set enabled ~show-trailing-whitespace~ globally.  0758efa

- Fixed showing available bindings on a single line instead of using
  the usual popup buffer.  2f011c9, 99d3bf6

- Added a line between the ~lv~ window and the echo area.  ca18bb6

- Fixed adding a new suffix at the end of a group and removing a
  group's last suffix.  #20, #6

- No longer use ~cl-typep~, which appears to have a bug on Emacs 25.
  9183fe1

- Fixed ~lisp~ make target.  170a3fd

- Fixed reading a number as the value of an infix.  8219c0b
